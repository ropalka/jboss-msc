/**
 * The service builder. It is used to configure the service before installing it into the container.
 * <p>
 * Service may require multiple values provided by other services in order to be able to start.
 * Every named value service will require must be declared via {@link #requires(String...)} method.
 * Once required values are configured and service is installed into the container
 * then declared values will be accessible via:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link StartContext#getValue(String)} method during execution of {@link Service#start(StartContext)} method</li>
 *     <li>{@link StopContext#getValue(String)} method during execution of {@link Service#stop(StopContext)} method</li>
 * </ul>
 * <p>
 * Service can provide multiple values which may be consumed by other services.
 * Every named value service will provide must be declared via {@link #provides(String...)} method.
 * Once provided values are configured and service is installed into the container
 * then declared values must be provided to the container via:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>{@link StartContext#setValue(String, Object)} method during execution of {@link Service#start(StartContext)} method</li>
 * </ul>
 * It is not necessary to clean up the provided values. The container will do it automatically when either service
 * start will fail or service will stop. However, it is required that installed service will provide all
 * declared provided values to the container otherwise service start process will fail.
 * <p>
 * The implementation of this interface is thread safe because it relies on thread confinement
 * i.e. the builder instance can be used only by thread that created it.
